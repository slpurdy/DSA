The Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci numbers is a good way of demonstrating what an algorithm is. 
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two before it.


The difference in the loop and recursion model:
Loop Model:
A set of instructions that repeats over and over until a certain condition is met.
The loop keeps executing the same set of instructions (like incrementing the number) until it reaches the end condition.
Loops are straightforward and run in a fixed pattern.

Recursion Model: 
A method calls itself. 
Recursion break into smaller chunks and solve them step by step.


The Big O Notation:
Loop Version: O(n) because it runs a loop n - 2 times
Recursive Version: O(n) because the method calls itself n - 2 times
